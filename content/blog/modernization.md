Modernization is an evergreen need, and it's increasingly looking like so. Startups are redefining how things should be done, using more and more technology to solve traditional problems. But they have one clear advantage. Due to their age, they don't have the argument that says "it's been like that always". They start from blank with an abstract idea, but they are also answerable to the investors. They keep trying to find innovative ways to do things cheaper, better, faster.

However, what about the large enterprises that are in business for say decades? They have a lot of legacy systems written years ago. And not mainframe; even java and .net feel old now. Many IT organizations confuse modernization with upgrading servers, platforms, and frameworks. Working on latest technologies also helps build the resume! Most times the target platforms and servers are upgraded, but a very old piece of code will continue to run unaltered. Also, it's costly to change code that's unfamiliar to the next gen developers. Besides, there is this saying, "don't fix it if it's not broken".

Cloud, DevOps, Microservices are a new set of keywords used extensively in IT world. Especially DevOps which is looked at like a magic bullet. Everyone wants to do continuous deployment. Creating a department with name as DevOps is how it starts, but doesn't go too far, or too fast. That's just one more silo.

What doesn't change during this is the behavior of the systems. The screens will look better but the functionality will not change. The business challenges remain unaddressed or partially addressed. What's worse, after some early successes, the silos that exist within large organizations, they will start competing to do the next cool thing first.

To some extent it's good if it remains healthy, call it gamification. But it might soon get tricky for everyone to handle. The race is not about who uses the next cool language first. But it should be more about how to solve the real world challenges.
There are a plenty of opportunities especially in the large organizations. They didn't change for a long time, until the startups powered by modern technologies started threatening the business. But that's where many opportunities lie, the potential for change is huge.

Surprisingly, people who get affected most in their day to day lives due to how things are the way they are, are also the most reluctant to change them. They also probably don't know how other departments work. To talk to an another one, they will have to go through two bosses at least. One their own, and the other from the other department.

But that's where the fun lies. People are adventurous in life when they go to skiing, hiking, or even trying a new restaurant or new food, a new city. But aren't those vacations planned well in advance? From booking tickets to listing places to visit, and so on. A carefully analyzed process followed by a calculated adventure will go a long way in working life as well. Even if it doesn't work at first, people will know where you stand. Besides, It's hugely satisfying when it finally works!

So when someone says next time, "it's always been like that"; that's the next big opportunity!
