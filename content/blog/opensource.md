It's thanksgiving time of the year! My current onsite workplace arranged for donations, food baskets, volunteering services for communities of the society.


There is another community though, the open-source community, that is sometimes under appreciated. Even the large organizations that traditionally stayed away from open-source, have started adopting it. And although it comes with some form of legal terms and conditions, it is free otherwise.

I have used open-source software for some of the projects over course of my work. So many times I have thought about how to give back to this community. The ultimate contribution would be writing an open-source product, or library, yourself of course.
But there are other, less time consuming ways as well. Ironic it may sound, but probably the easiest way to get started is finding what's wrong, or missing, with the open-source library! A defect, a feature request for example. As ultimately it's going to make the product better.

The next level would be, going through the defects already raised by someone. If you have skills, and if time permits, some defects can be easily fixed. For example, spelling and grammar mistakes in documentation.

If you have development skills, then you can start fixing technical defects or even developing new feature requests. The truth is though, you are not just giving it back, you are gaining something as well. If you can really contribute to some of the popular ones, not only you gain experience yourself, it also strengthens you resume! It's a win-win situation.

The last but not the least, some open-source creators accept donations, as small as a cost of a single coffee. It may feel strange, or counter to the idea of free and open, but after all you don't want a free product to disappear, or even stop evolving, when you are using it and started getting dependent on it.

I have made my own tiny contributions. But I also think the large organizations that get benefitted by open-source should also find a way to give it back.
